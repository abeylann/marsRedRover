# marsRedRover

<h3> Description </h3>
This code is a possible solution for the Martian Robots problem.

<ul>-The user inputs the size of a planet in the form (x y).</ul>
<ul>-Then, the user inputs the position and location of a robot in the form (x y z) where z is the orientation determined by N, S, E, W.</ul>
<ul><p>-Finally the user inputs the serie of instructions that the robot has to follow in the form L, R and F where L means turn left, R means turn righ and F means move forward.</p></ul>
<ul> -When the user wants to stop adding robots, only has to input the word "finish"</ul>

<p>If a robot falls, it will print the final position plus the work LOST</p> 
<p>If a robot "falls" from the planet, it ill leave a "scent", preventing other robots to commit the same mistake and therefore prints the last save position.</p>
